## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want to see which learning objectives are demonstrating low proficiency within the selected course content so that I can quickly identify areas that need attention and dig deeper into student understanding. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Tile Presence & Scope Given  an instructor is viewing the Learning Dashboard Then  a  “Challenging Objectives”  tile is displayed The tile reflects data scoped to the currently selected global course content filter (e.g., Entire Course, unit, module). Displayed Content The Challenging Objectives tile displays: Learning objectives and sub-objectives with  low proficiency  (defined as  equal to or   less than 40% in Torus ) within the selected container Learning Objectives are numbered according to their order in the curriculum Description: “Your class is demonstrating  low proficiency (≤ 40%)  for these learning objectives.” Given  a learning objective has associated sub-objectives: Then  sub-objectives are displayed within an expandable dropdown beneath the parent objective Sub-objectives are numbered according to their status below the Objective or order in the curriculum Hover, focus, and expanded states follow the designs defined in Figma. Navigation Behavior When  an instructor selects a  learning objective : Then  they are navigated to  Insights → Learning Objectives And  the selected learning objective row is expanded When  an instructor selects a  sub-objective : Then  they are navigated to  Insights → Learning Objectives And  the corresponding sub-objective is visible and highlighted in context When  an instructor selects the  “View Learning Objectives”  button: Then  they are navigated to  Insights → Learning Objectives And  the view defaults to the  All Learning Objectives  view with no rows expanded Empty & Conditional States Given  a course contains  no learning objectives : Then  the Challenging Objectives tile is  not displayed Given  learning objectives exist but none fall below the low-proficiency threshold: Then  the tile displays the following message: “There are currently no learning objectives with low proficiency in [Container].” And   [Container]  reflects the currently selected course content filter (e.g., Entire Course, Unit 2) Negative Acceptance Criteria Given  a learning objective has no sub-objectives: Then  no expandable control is shown Given  the selected container contains learning objectives but no proficiency data yet: Then  the tile displays an appropriate informational state rather than low-proficiency results Given  the instructor rapidly changes the global course filter: Then  the Challenging Objectives tile updates consistently without stale or mismatched data Given  navigation to the Insights → Learning Objectives page fails: Then  an error state is shown rather than leaving the instructor in an undefined state Design Notes   Accessibility Guidelines  Expand / Collapse Controls Expand and collapse controls for learning objectives must: Be operable via keyboard (Enter / Space) Have a visible focus indicator Clearly communicate their state programmatically (expanded vs. collapsed) Expand/collapse buttons must include accessible labels such as: “Expand learning objective” “Collapse learning objective” Changes in expanded state must be announced to assistive technologies where appropriate. Navigation & Link Behavior Learning objectives and sub-objectives must be implemented as proper interactive elements (e.g., links or buttons), not click-only containers. When an instructor selects an objective or sub-objective:  The navigation destination must be announced to assistive technologies (e.g., “Navigating to Learning Objectives”). Focus must be managed appropriately on navigation: When navigating to  Insights → Learning Objectives , focus should land on the relevant expanded objective or sub-objective where feasible. Technical Notes Testing Notes

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a feature, use slug objectives_tile We need just the objectives oracle and the the course content titles oracle. The feature concrete_oracles defines these modules and interfaces and data payloads. It is fine to directly use SectionResourceDepot to construct parent-child objective “trees” if the only thing returned back from the objectives oracle is low performing subobjectives.
