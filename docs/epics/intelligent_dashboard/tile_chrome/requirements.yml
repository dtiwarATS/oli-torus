  title: Build reusable dashboard section chrome components in dashboard-shared UI
    modules with no dependency on instructor-specific tile code.
  status: proposed

  - id: AC-001
    title: "(FR-001) \u2014 Given reusable chrome package, when consumed by instructor\
      \ dashboard, then it renders arbitrary section children without importing instructor-specific\
      \ tiles."

- id: FR-002
  title: Chrome supports section collapse/expand with default expanded state and emits
    expansion change callback to consuming dashboard.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-002
    title: "(FR-002) \u2014 Given instructor toggles section caret, when action completes,\
      \ then section expands/collapses and callback emits updated expansion state."

  title: Chrome supports section drag-reorder with visual feedback and emits updated
    order callback on drop.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-003
    title: "(FR-003) \u2014 Given instructor drags section handle, when dropped, then\
      \ section order updates immediately and callback emits new ordered identifiers."

- id: FR-004
  title: Instructor dashboard persists order and expansion preferences at section
    scope (shared among instructors in same section).
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-004
    title: "(FR-004, FR-005) \u2014 Given reorder/collapse actions are saved, when\
      \ another instructor opens same section dashboard, then saved layout state matches\
      \ section-level persisted preferences across scopes."

  title: Instructor dashboard applies tile eligibility rules before passing sections
    to chrome (including Content-section suppression when both objectives and assessments
    tiles are ineligible).
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-005
    title: "(FR-006, FR-007) \u2014 Given course has no objectives and no graded assessments,\
      \ when dashboard composes sections, then Content section is omitted entirely."
    status: proposed
    verification_method: automated
    proofs: []
- id: FR-007
  title: Sections with zero eligible tiles are omitted entirely; sections with one
    tile render that tile full-width with section controls preserved.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-006
    title: "(FR-007) \u2014 Given section has exactly one eligible tile, when rendered,\
      \ then tile spans full width and section controls remain available."
    status: proposed

  title: Reordering is section-level only; tiles cannot be dragged across sections
    and invalid nested positions are prevented.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-007
    title: "(FR-008) \u2014 Given drag interaction, when user attempts invalid nested/cross-tile\
      \ movement, then system prevents invalid reordering."
    status: proposed
    verification_method: automated
    proofs: []
- id: FR-009
  title: Reorder actions do not auto-collapse sections and preserve existing expansion
    state.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-008
    title: "(FR-009) \u2014 Given section is collapsed then reordered, when reorder\
      \ completes, then collapse state is preserved."
