## Ticket Description
User Story As an  instructor , I want  dashboard tiles to be grouped in meaningful sections that I can reorder , so that I can customize the learning dashboard to match my goals and priorities. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Dashboard Sections Given  the instructor is in the Learning Dashboard Then  dashboard tiles are organized into the following sections: Engagement Section Section title:  Engagement Contains: Progress tile Student Support tile Content Section Section title:  Content Contains: Challenging Objectives tile Assessments tile Section Expand / Collapse Given  a dashboard section is displayed Then : A  caret icon  appears to the  left of the section title The section is  expanded by default When  the instructor clicks the caret icon Then : The section  collapses , hiding its tiles Clicking the caret again  re-expands  the section The new section order retains state (save this preference) Section Reordering Given  a dashboard section is displayed Then : A  drag handle (three-dot icon)  appears in the  upper-right corner  of the section header On hover, a tooltip labeled “Move” appears When  the instructor drags the handle Then : The section can be repositioned  above or below other sections Visual feedback during hover, drag, and drop matches  Figma specifications And : The new section order is immediately reflected in the dashboard The new section order retains state (save this preference) Conditional Section Rendering Section Visibility Rules Given  the instructor is on the Learning Dashboard When  a dashboard section contains  no eligible tiles  Then : The  entire section is not rendered The section: Does not appear visually Does not reserve vertical space Does not appear in section reordering interactions Example : If a course has  no Challenging Objectives and no Assessments in the entire course , the  Content  section is not displayed Single-Tile Section Behavior Given  a dashboard section contains  exactly one eligible tile Then : The remaining tile  expands to fill the full width  of the section container No empty or placeholder tile is displayed Section-level controls (caret, drag handle) remain available Example : If a course has Assessments but no Challenging Objectives: The  Assessments  tile spans the full width of the  Content  section Negative Acceptance Criteria Do not  allow tiles to be dragged  outside  of their section Do not  collapse a section automatically when it is reordered Do not  reorder sections without clear visual feedback during drag Do not  reset section order on page refresh or navigation (unless persistence is explicitly out of scope) Do not  hide or disable section controls (caret or drag handle) Do not  allow sections to be reordered into invalid positions (e.g., nested inside other sections) Do not  display empty sections with: No tiles Do not  display empty tile shells to preserve layout symmetry Do not  collapse or hide a section solely because it contains only one tile Do not  change tile span behavior when both tiles are present Design Notes Collapsable Sections    Drag & Drop Sections    Accessibility Guidelines Perceivable When a section is not rendered (because it has zero eligible tiles),  no empty container, header, or divider  is displayed visually. If a section contains one tile and that tile expands, the expanded layout  maintains readable structure  (no overlapping text, clipped content, or truncated headings without a way to access full text). Focus indicators remain clearly visible on the expanded tile and any interactive elements inside it. Operable (Keyboard) Keyboard navigation order updates logically when sections are hidden or shown: No “tab stops”  exist for non-rendered sections (no hidden-but-focusable controls).

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a FEATURE.  slug is tile_chrome Proposed technical guidance for implementation 1) Architecture boundary: reusable dashboard section chrome - Build a reusable UI module for “dashboard section chrome” that is not instructor-dashboard-specific. - This module should own generic section behavior: - section header rendering - expand/collapse interaction - section drag/reorder interaction - visual state for hover/drag/drop - Keep it tile-agnostic and dashboard-agnostic: - no direct imports of instructor dashboard code - no direct dependency on concrete tile implementations - render arbitrary child components supplied by callers 2) Integration contract with consuming dashboards - Expose a clean API so consuming dashboards pass: - initial section definitions and order - expansion state - callbacks for state changes - Required callbacks/events from reusable module: -  on_section_order_changed(new_order) -  on_section_expansion_changed(section_id, expanded?) - The consuming dashboard (in this story, instructor dashboard) owns persistence and any data reload side effects. 3) Persistence model (explicit requirement) - Persist section chrome preferences at section level (shared across instructors in same section), not per instructor. - Persist only at section scope (not section+module/unit scope). - Rationale: layout preference is dashboard-level user intent and should remain stable across module/unit filters. - Persist both: - section order - collapsed/expanded state 4) Save/re-render flow - On reorder drop completion: 1. reusable module emits new order 2. instructor dashboard persists section-level layout prefs 3. instructor dashboard updates rendered state from persisted/accepted values - On collapse/expand toggle: 1. reusable module emits expansion change 2. instructor dashboard persists section-level layout prefs 3. UI reflects updated state immediately - Keep this deterministic and idempotent so refresh/navigation restores the same layout. 5) Instructor-dashboard-specific eligibility logic (not reusable chrome) - Tile eligibility and section suppression rules live in instructor dashboard composition code, not in reusable chrome. - For Content section: - Do not render Challenging Objectives tile if course has no learning objectives. - Do not render Assessments tile if course has no graded pages/assessments. - If both are ineligible, do not render Content section at all. - This requires an upfront data check in dashboard code before section composition. 6) Composition behavior after eligibility filtering - Reusable section chrome receives only eligible sections/tiles. - If a section has one eligible tile, render full-width tile within section container. - If a section has zero eligible tiles, omit section entirely (no empty header/container/divider, no reorder surface). - Section controls (caret, drag handle) remain available for visible sections, including single-tile sections. 7) Reordering constraints and UX guardrails - Reordering occurs at section level only. - Tiles must not be draggable across sections in this story. - Prevent invalid reorder states (e.g., nested sections). - Preserve collapse state when a section is moved; reorder must not auto-collapse. 8) Accessibility and interaction expectations - Keep controls keyboard-operable and semantically correct: - caret button and drag handle must be reachable and announced properly - no focusable artifacts for non-rendered sections - keyboard traversal order updates correctly after hide/show/reorder - Ensure drag/reorder has clear non-visual and visual feedback paths consistent with design guidance. 9) Suggested acceptance criteria addendum - “Section order and expansion state are persisted per section and shared across instructors in that section.” - “Layout persistence applies across dashboard filters/scopes (not stored per module/unit).” - “Reusable section chrome is implemented without dependencies on instructor-dashboard-specific tiles or modules.” - “Eligibility decisions for Content tiles/section are made in instructor dashboard composition logic before rendering reusable section chrome.”
