## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want an at-a-glance view of my students grouped by progress and proficiency so that I can quickly identify who needs support, who is on track, and who is excelling—and take action when needed. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Student Support Tile – Presence & Purpose Given  an instructor is viewing the Learning Dashboard Then  a tile titled  “Student Support”  is displayed And  the tile description reads: “Filter students by progress and proficiency to identify who needs support or is excelling.” The tile includes a  “View Student Overview”  button: When  clicked Then  the instructor is navigated to  Overview → Students Course Start / No Data State Given  the course has  no student activity data yet Then  the Student Support tile displays the following message where the donut chart usually is: “Student support insights will appear once students begin engaging. Students with no activity will appear with an inactivity indicator once the course begins.” Donut Visualization (Performance Groups) Performance Buckets (Buckets follow priority ordering; students can only be in 1 bucket) Struggling   Progress <40% OR  >80%   AND Proficiency < 40% Excelling Progress ≥ 60%  AND Proficiency ≥ 80% On Track Everything that falls outside of Struggling or Excelling Note:  thresholds will be customizable in a future ticket. Not enough information (N/A) Students who do not have enough proficiency data to determine their performance bucket are grouped here Donut Filtering Interactions Default view is the “struggling” category The donut legend displays: Bucket name Percentage of students Student count Each legend item is an interactive button: When  selected Then  the donut highlights the corresponding segment And  the student list updates to show only students in that bucket Each donut segment is also clickable and mirrors legend behavior. Student List Behavior General List Rules The student list displays: Student count Group definition Search input (searches within the current list) Displays  20 students at a time Uses a vertical scrollbar to maintain fixed tile height Load More Given  more than 20 students exist in the list Then  a  “Load more”  button appears The button includes the number of remaining students in parentheses The list should  not  scroll back to the top when “Load more” is clicked – users should stay where they were in the list & content should follow underneath Active / Inactive Status For this ticket , inactivity is defined as: No student activity in the past 7 days Note: Inactivity rules will be customizable in a future ticket. Filtering by Activity Below the search bar, display two filters: Active Inactive On hover, display tooltip Inactive = no activity in the past 7 days Each filter: Displays the count  of students in the currently selected bucket Updates the student list when selected Inactive students are visually indicated with: A red dot icon  on the student avatar The same indicator applied to the “Inactive” filter when active Selection & Emailing Each student row includes a checkbox A master checkbox allows selecting all students currently visible in the list The  Email  button: Is disabled when no students are selected Becomes active when one or more students are selected When  clicked: Opens the email modal Pre-populates recipients with the selected students Negative Acceptance Criteria Students  cannot appear in more than one performance bucket Students  are not assigned  to Struggling, On Track, or Excelling when there is insufficient data The donut chart and student list  do not render  when the course has no activity data Filters and interactions  do not change bucket definitions or logic The student list  does not show more than 20 students at a time  without clicking “Load more” Clicking “Load more”  does not reset scroll position or duplicate students Inactive status  does not override  a student’s performance bucket The Email button  cannot be used  unless at least one student is selected The master checkbox  does not select students outside the visible list Thresholds and inactivity rules  are not customizable  in this ticket Design Notes Component   Default No Inactive Students    Donut Hover State   Technical Notes Testing Notes

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a FEATURE.  slug is support_tile This feature uses the 2D progress-proficiency oracle, student roster oracle (look up exact oracle modules in concrete_oracles) to project data to create the pie chart visualization,  Vega Lite for the viz, pay careful attention to the viz interactivity - the clicking on a slice changes the list of displayed students.  All of that is handled inside the overall support tile component, but decompose of course the pie chart component apart from the list of students.   The active, inactive bucketing of students is done on Tile projection space (NON UI CODE) using the  last_interaction_at  in the StudentInfoOracle All of the rest of the clicking and filtering and state is handled internally to the support tile componenttry
