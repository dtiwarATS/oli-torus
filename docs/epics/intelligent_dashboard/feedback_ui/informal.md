## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want to provide feedback on AI recommendations and regenerate them so that I can improve their usefulness and explore alternative insights. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria AI Feedback Controls Given  an instructor is viewing the Learning Dashboard And  an AI recommendation is displayed in the summary section Then  the recommendation includes the following feedback controls: Thumbs up Tooltip on hover or focus:  “Good recommendation” Thumbs down Tooltip on hover or focus:  “Bad recommendation” Regenerate Tooltip on hover or focus:  “Regenerate recommendation” Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down Feedback Given  an instructor selects  Thumbs up Then  the recommendation is recorded as positive feedback for the AI system And  the thumbs up / thumbs down icons are replaced with an  “Additional feedback”  button Given  an instructor selects  Thumbs down Then  the recommendation is recorded as negative feedback for the AI system And  the thumbs up / thumbs down icons are replaced with an  “Additional feedback”  button Additional Feedback Modal Given  an instructor selects  “Additional feedback” Then  a modal appears allowing the instructor to submit qualitative feedback And  the modal includes: A free-text input field A submit action A cancel action When  the instructor submits additional feedback Then  the feedback is sent to the designated admin Slack channel And  a confirmation message is displayed to the instructor indicating successful submission Regenerate Recommendation Given  an instructor selects  Regenerate Then  a “Thinking…” indicator is displayed while the recommendation is being regenerated And  a new AI recommendation is displayed upon completion And  the regenerated recommendation is based on the currently selected dashboard data and filters Negative Acceptance Criteria Given  an instructor has already submitted thumbs up or thumbs down feedback Then  they cannot submit thumbs feedback again for the same recommendation instance Given  the AI recommendation fails to regenerate (e.g., error or timeout) Then  an appropriate error or fallback message is displayed And  the previous recommendation remains visible Given  the instructor opens the additional feedback modal and cancels Then  no feedback is submitted And  the instructor is returned to the Learning Dashboard without state loss Design Notes Note: this is just to get an idea, I couldn’t prototype it fully   Additional Feedback Accessibility Guidelines (AI Feedback Controls) Icon-Only Buttons (Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down, Regenerate) All icon-only buttons must have  accessible names  that clearly describe their action: Examples: “Good recommendation,” “Bad recommendation,” “Regenerate recommendation” Accessible names must be programmatically associated using  aria-label  or visible text equivalents. Icon-only buttons must: Be fully operable via keyboard Display a visible focus indicator when focused Tooltips Tooltips must be accessible via  hover and keyboard focus . Tooltip content must be announced to screen readers using appropriate ARIA associations (e.g.,  aria-describedby ). Tooltips must not trap keyboard focus or interfere with interaction with nearby controls. Additional Feedback Modal When the modal opens: Keyboard focus must move to the modal container or first interactive element Focus must be trapped within the modal until it is closed The modal must include: A clear, programmatically associated title (e.g.,  aria-labelledby ) All modal actions (submit, cancel, close) must be operable via keyboard. When the modal closes: Focus must return to the element that triggered the modal (e.g., “Additional feedback” button). Error messages and submission confirmations must be announced to assistive technologies. Technical Notes Testing Notes
