  title: Use concrete progress and content-title oracle data to build a non-UI projection
    model consumed by the chart component.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-002
    title: "(FR-002, FR-009) \u2014 Given progress oracle payloads, when projection\

  title: Render chart axis granularity based on selected scope level (course->units,
    unit->modules, module->children).
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-004
    title: "(FR-004) \u2014 Given scope is Entire Course/Unit/Module, when chart renders,\

  title: Provide y-axis mode toggle between student count and class percentage without
    full page reload.

  - id: AC-005
    title: "(FR-005) \u2014 Given instructor toggles count/percentage mode, when toggle\
      \ changes, then y-axis values and bar tooltips update without page refresh."

  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-007
    title: "(FR-007) \u2014 Given too many x-axis items for viewport width, when tile\
