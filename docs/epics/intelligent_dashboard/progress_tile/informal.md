## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want an at-a-glance view of how students are progressing through course content so that I can quickly see what has been completed and where students may be falling behind. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Progress Tile Presence & Context Given  an instructor is viewing the Learning Dashboard Then  a  Progress  tile is displayed The Progress tile reflects data scoped to the currently selected global course content filter (e.g., Entire Course, unit, module). Tile Description (Schedule-Aware Messaging) Given  the instructor has configured a schedule in Torus Then  the tile description reads: “View content students have completed compared to the schedule.” And  the schedule is visually represented in the chart  Given  the instructor has  not  configured a schedule Then  the tile description reads: “View content students have completed.” And  no schedule-related visual indicators are displayed Top  Level Content The Progress tile displays: Class size  (total number of students included in the view) Text button in the upper right-hand corner “View Progress Details” When clicked, the user is directed to the  “Insights” > “Content” page Completion Threshold Control The tile includes a  Completion Threshold  control that allows instructors to define what “complete” means for this visualization. The completion threshold: Is displayed as a dropdown Includes selectable values from  10%–100% Updates the visualization dynamically when changed Tooltip text for Completion Threshold: “Because pages have different rules, reaching 100% completion isn’t always possible. This lets you choose what ‘complete’ means for this visualization.” Visualization Behavior The Progress tile displays a  bar chart  showing the number of students who have completed each content item. Chart structure adapts based on the global filter : Entire Course → displays  units Unit → displays  modules Module → displays  pages (and so on, following the course hierarchy & depending on what course containers a course uses) The  x-axis : Displays the appropriate content labels for the current level Truncates long labels when space is limited (with ellipsis) On hover, shows entire label in tooltip The  y-axis : Displays either  student count  or  percentage , based on the selected toggle On hover  over a bar: A tooltip displays the exact number of students represented Schedule Visualization (When Applicable) Given  a schedule is set in Torus: A  dotted vertical line  indicates the current scheduled position in the course Content  behind the scheduled point  is visually de-emphasized (e.g., red cast), per Figma Hovering over the schedule indicator displays a tooltip explaining the schedule position Given  no schedule is set: No schedule indicators, tooltips, or visual treatments are displayed Pagination Given  the number of content items exceeds the available horizontal space: Pagination arrows appear in the  top-right  of the visualization Arrows follow active/inactive states in figma Selecting arrows navigates through additional content bars X-axis label truncation visually indicates additional content exists Percentage vs. Count Toggle The tile includes a toggle allowing instructors to switch the y-axis between: Student count (#) Percentage of class (%) Changing the toggle updates the visualization without a page refresh. Negative Acceptance Criteria Given  the selected container contains no student activity Then  the Progress tile displays an appropriate empty state Given  the class size is zero Then  the visualization is not rendered and an explanatory message is shown Given  the completion threshold is set to a value that results in no completed content Then  the chart remains visible and accurately reflects zero completions Given  the instructor rapidly changes filters, thresholds, or toggles Then  the visualization updates consistently without visual glitches or stale data Design Notes No Schedule    Small Course      Displaying   Modules    Displaying   Pages    Accessibility Guidelines Each bar must be programmatically associated with: The corresponding content label (e.g., unit or page name) Its value (student count or percentage) Chart content must remain usable at  200% zoom  without loss of information or interaction. Tooltips (Bars, Completion Threshold, Schedule Indicators) Tooltips must be accessible via  hover and keyboard focus . Tooltip content must be announced to screen readers using appropriate ARIA associations (e.g.,  aria-describedby ). Toggles (Percentage vs. Count) The percentage vs. count toggle must: Be operable via keyboard Expose its current state programmatically (e.g., “Showing values as percentage”) Toggle state changes must be announced to assistive technologies. The toggle must have a visible focus indicator and clear label describing its purpose. Pagination Controls Pagination arrows must: Be reachable and operable via keyboard Have accessible labels describing their action (e.g., “View next set of content”) Clearly communicate disabled states programmatically and visually When pagination changes the visible chart content: The update must be announced to screen readers using an appropriate  aria-live  region. Truncated x-axis labels must expose full content names via an accessible mechanism. Technical Notes Testing Notes

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a feature, use slug progress_tile This  feature will use the course content title oracle and progress oracles (look up exact references from concrete_oracles). It will perform necessary data projections  in a non UI component in the code .   The UI impl of this component will be a Vega Lite rendered chart, powered by the projected data.  We need the UI component to manage re-projecting when the Progress level filter is selected.
