## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want to download the data shown on the Instructor Dashboard as CSV files so that I can review, analyze, and share course insights outside of Torus (e.g., in Excel or research tools), including when I use assistive technologies (this will provide an accessible alternative to interactive visualizations). Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Entry Point Given an instructor is on the Instructor Dashboard Then a button labeled  “Download dashboard data (CSV)”  is available The button is keyboard accessible and screen-reader labeled Export Behavior When the instructor selects  Download dashboard data (CSV) Then a ZIP file is downloaded And the ZIP filename includes course + timestamp (e.g.,  torus_dashboard_export_2026-02-04.zip ) ZIP Contents The ZIP contains the following CSV files (if data exists for that section): dashboard_metadata.csv Includes course name, section, dashboard scope, timestamp, timezone, completion threshold, proficiency definition, total students course_summary_metrics.csv Average class proficiency Average assessment score Average student progress student_progress_by_unit.csv Unit name Students completed Completion rate student_support_summary.csv Support category (struggling, on track, excelling, inactive, not enough information) Student count Percentage student_support_list.csv Student ID Student name Progress % Proficiency % Support category Inactive flag challenging_learning_objectives.csv Learning objective ID Objective text Average proficiency Status (e.g., low) assessment_scores_distribution.csv Assessment name Score range Student count assessment_summary.csv Assessment name Availability dates Completion counts Score statistics (min, median, mean, max, std dev) Design Notes Example ZIP folder   Accessibility Requirements CSV export serves as a  text-based alternative  for dashboard visualizations Feature supports WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria: 1.1.1 Non-text Content 1.3.1 Info and Relationships 2.1.1 Keyboard 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a FEATURE.  slug is csv_download Proposed technical guidance for implementation 1) Primary goal and scope fidelity - Export is a ZIP bundle of CSV files representing the same data currently shown in the dashboard. - Export must honor current UI state at click time: - selected dashboard scope (e.g., course vs module/unit view) - active tile parameter settings (e.g., progress threshold/proficiency definition, student support parameters) - Do not export full-course data when the UI is filtered to a narrower scope. 2) Architecture: tile-driven dataset provider contract - Implement a tile-level export contract rather than a centralized projection-only contract. - Each tile/module should expose a function that returns zero or more export datasets for its current rendered state. - Suggested shape per dataset: -  file_name -  rows  (normalized tabular data) - optional  columns /header order metadata - Rationale: tiles may combine multiple oracle streams and custom projection logic to produce one or more final views; tile code is the right boundary for defining exportable datasets. 3) Non-UI export services - Add non-UI modules for: - CSV rendering from  {file_name, rows, columns } datasets - ZIP assembly from many CSV files (in memory) - Keep these modules dashboard-domain services (reusable by dashboard features), independent from LiveView UI concerns. 4) LiveView orchestration flow - On  Download dashboard data (CSV)  event: 1. Gather current dashboard state (scope + active settings). 2. Ask each relevant tile for export datasets derived from its current state/projections. 3. Build required CSV files (including metadata/summary files from shared state). 4. Assemble ZIP in memory. 5. Trigger file download response. - This path should not issue new heavy queries; rely on already available in-memory/stateful data where possible. 5) Metadata and naming consistency - Ensure  dashboard_metadata.csv  captures the active context used to generate export (course, section, scope, timestamp, timezone, completion/proficiency settings, etc.). - ZIP file naming should follow ticket convention with timestamp. - CSV content must align with the current tile view semantics, not a separate reporting interpretation. 6) Synchronous-first trade-off (explicit decision) - Decision: keep export generation synchronous in the request path for this iteration. - Why acceptable now: - bounded dataset sizes in dashboard views - no new expensive data fetches expected for export assembly - implementation simplicity and lower operational complexity than async job orchestration - Guardrail: - include lightweight loading/disabled-button UI feedback while generation is in progress. - Future pivot trigger: - if telemetry shows latency/timeouts or payload growth, move to async export job + ready-for-download flow. 7) Empty/optional dataset behavior - A tile can return zero datasets when no data is present for current scope. - ZIP should include only applicable files for the current section/scope per acceptance criteria (“if data exists”). - Do not emit placeholder CSVs that imply unavailable data. 8) Suggested acceptance criteria addendum - “Export reflects the dashboard’s current scope and active parameter settings at the time of download.” - “Each tile contributes export datasets through a tile-level contract, enabling complex projection logic to remain tile-owned.” - “CSV and ZIP assembly are performed by non-UI services; LiveView coordinates and triggers download.” - “Initial implementation is synchronous with visible loading feedback; async export is deferred unless performance indicates need.”
