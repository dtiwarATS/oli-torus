## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want to customize the Student Support tile parameters—specifically performance group thresholds and inactivity definitions—so the student groupings reflect what I consider important for monitoring and intervention. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Entry Point Given an instructor is viewing the Student Support tile Then an  Edit parameters  icon is visible When the instructor hovers over the icon A tooltip appears with the text:  “Edit parameters” When the instructor clicks the icon Then a modal titled  “Customize student support parameters”  opens Modal Structure The modal contains two sections: Inactivity Group Ranges 1. Inactivity Section Instructors can define how long a student must be inactive to be labeled as inactive Default setting: Last visit > 7 days Supported options: 7 days 14 days 30 days 90 days Inactivity is stored independently from performance group assignment 2. Performance Groups Section / Group Ranges Threshold Configuration Struggling  and  Excelling  include configurable thresholds for: Progress (%) Proficiency (%) Thresholds are adjusted using: Draggable boundaries within the matrix Numeric inputs with increment/decrement controls (keyboard accessible) Threshold values are expressed as percentages (0–100%) Comparator logic (e.g.,  < ,  ≥ ) is fixed and not editable by the instructor Performance Group Rules Rule 1 — Exactly One Performance Group Each student  with sufficient proficiency data  is assigned to  one and only one  performance group Rule 2 — Threshold-Based Assignment Group membership is determined by evaluating: Student progress against configured progress thresholds Student proficiency against configured proficiency thresholds Group criteria are evaluated using logical conditions defined per group Example configuration: Struggling: Progress  < 40%   OR   > 80% AND Proficiency  ≤ 40% Excelling: Progress  ≥ 60% AND Proficiency  ≥ 80% On track: All remaining students with sufficient proficiency data Rule 3 — Overlap Constraints Excelling and Struggling thresholds cannot overlap The system prevents: The excelling proficiency boundary from crossing the struggling proficiency boundary The excelling progress boundary from crossing the struggling progress boundary When adjusting thresholds: Invalid configurations are blocked or constrained in real time Rule 4 — Insufficient Data Students who do not have enough proficiency data to be evaluated: Are excluded from performance groups Appear under  “Not enough information”  in the donut chart Remain visible in the full student list Saving When the instructor selects “Save” The new thresholds are applied The donut visualization updates Negative Acceptance Criteria Selecting  Cancel , clicking outside the modal, or pressing  Esc  discards all changes Changes are not applied unless  Save  is selected Inactivity settings do not affect performance group assignment Threshold values cannot: Exceed  0–100% Accept non-numeric input Allow editing of comparator logic Struggling and Excelling thresholds cannot overlap A student cannot appear in more than one performance group Students without sufficient proficiency data are not assigned to any performance group Visualizations do not update until changes are saved All threshold controls must be keyboard operable Design Notes Example showing interaction:   Technical Notes Testing Notes

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a FEATURE, slug is customize_parameters Proposed technical guidance for implementation 1) Source of truth and scope - Support parameter settings (including the customized “Inactive” days length) must be scoped at the section level (shared across instructors in the same section), not per instructor. - Rationale: instructor-specific settings would produce conflicting counts/grouping views in the same course section. - Required baseline: each section has a default configuration; if no customization exists yet, use defaults. 2) Load behavior - On tile load, resolve the active parameter set in this order: 1. persisted section customization (if present) 2. section default configuration - Use that active parameter set when requesting/rendering Student Support group results. - The tile should always render counts/charts based on the active settings currently in effect for the section. 3) Modal ownership and interaction contract - Treat the “Customize student support parameters” modal as part of the Student Support tile feature boundary (same UI sub-module/flow), even if implemented in separate files. - The tile opens the modal and receives an explicit payload of edited settings on Save. - Cancel, outside-click, and Esc must close without applying or persisting any edits. 4) Save flow (critical sequence) - On Save, execute this sequence: 1. Validate edited settings (range checks, non-overlap constraints, etc.) 2. Persist settings for the section 3. After successful persistence, trigger tile reprojection/reload using the newly persisted settings 4. Re-render chart/list with updated grouping/counts - Do not update visualization from unsaved edits. 5) Reprojection expectation - Parameter changes are not cosmetic; they change grouping logic and therefore require recalculation/reprojection of Student Support data. - The post-save state must reflect recomputed results under the new thresholds/inactivity window. 6) Consistency/concurrency notes - Last successful save becomes section truth. - If multiple instructors are viewing simultaneously, refreshed loads should converge on persisted section settings. - If save fails, keep existing persisted settings active and show an error; do not partially apply. 7) Suggested acceptance criteria addendum - “Customized student support parameters are persisted per section and are visible to any instructor who opens the dashboard for that section.” - “After Save, the Student Support tile immediately reprojections/reloads data using the saved parameter set.” - “Unsaved edits (Cancel/Esc/outside click) do not change persisted settings or tile outputs.”  The visualization in the UI design may be too challenging to build in VegaLite due to the level of interactivity.  I recommend building this as pure SVG as a TypeScript/React component, that will do all client side rendering and processing.  That react comoponent will plug into and render from the LiveView or LV Component using our standard React to LV bridge mechanism.  There is plenty of prior art in this space for other components built like that.
