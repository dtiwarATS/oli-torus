## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want to see a top-level summary of key course metrics and a contextual AI recommendation so that I can quickly understand course performance and decide where to focus next. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Summary Placement & Structure Given  an instructor is viewing the Learning Dashboard Then  a  Summary section  is displayed directly below the global course content filter And  the summary section contains metric tiles and an AI recommendation Metric Summary Tiles Given  a course content filter is applied (Entire Course, unit, module, section) Then  the summary tiles reflect data scoped to the selected container only The summary section may include the following metric tiles: Average Class Proficiency Displays the average proficiency across learning objectives in the selected container Includes a tooltip that displays the definition on hover or focus If no learning objectives exist in the selected container, this tile is not shown Average Assessment Score Displays the average score across assessments in the selected container Includes a tooltip that displays the definition on hover or focus If no assessments exist in the selected container, this tile is not shown Average Student Progress Displays average progress through the selected container Includes a tooltip that displays the definition on hover or focus Given  one or more metric tiles are hidden due to missing data Then  the remaining tiles expand to fill the available space responsively Visual Design The summary section background follows the gradient defined in Figma Metric tiles visually align with existing dashboard styling and hierarchy AI Recommendation Given  the Learning Dashboard is displayed Then  an  AI Recommendation  appears within the summary section The AI recommendation: Is generated  once a day (date-driven)  using data from the  currently selected content filter Updates dynamically when the content filter changes If time is needed for loading, display  “Thinking” state Uses the AI icon and the label  “AI Recommendation” Follows the behavior and constraints defined in the  AI Recommendation POC    Note: Excludes feedback-related information for this ticket Beginning course state: “Students haven’t started yet. This dashboard will surface progress, proficiency, and areas needing attention as soon as activity begins.” Negative Acceptance Criteria Given  only one metric is applicable for the selected container Then  that metric is displayed without placeholders for missing metrics Given  the Learning Dashboard is loading or data is delayed Then  the summary section displays a loading indicator rather than empty or misleading values Given  an instructor navigates between containers using the content filter Then  metric values and the AI recommendation update consistently and without requiring a page refresh Design Notes Dark Mode   Light Mode   Thinking State   Accessibility Guidelines (Tooltips & AI Content) Tooltips (Metric Definitions) Tooltips must be accessible via both  mouse and keyboard : Appear on hover  and  when the tooltip trigger receives keyboard focus. Tooltip content must be readable by screen readers: Use appropriate ARIA attributes to associate the tooltip with its triggering element. Tooltip triggers must have a visible focus indicator when navigated via keyboard. AI Recommendation Content The AI recommendation must be perceivable and understandable by assistive technologies: The AI icon and label  “AI Recommendation”  must be programmatically associated with the recommendation content. Screen readers should announce AI-generated content clearly, for example: “AI Recommendation: …” Technical Notes Testing Notes

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a FEATURE.  slug is summary_tile Technical direction:  Tile needs to be created that uses four optional oracles (meaning each component can incrementally render as these oracles become available):  progress, proficiency_progress, assessment and recommendation.  Make sure the PRD for this story cross checks with concrete_oracles to find the EXACT oracle names and full module references.  Bulk of the rest of the feature impl is UI, building the four sub-tiles to render picture perfect according to design spec.  And also the thumb up, thumbs down feedback and the “regenerate” recommendation button.  Make sure the regen button stays disabled while there is an active regen request in flight.
