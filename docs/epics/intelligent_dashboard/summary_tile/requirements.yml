  title: Summary section consumes up to four optional data sources (progress, proficiency_progress,
    assessment, recommendation) and renders incrementally as each becomes available.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-002
    title: "(FR-002) \u2014 Given only a subset of optional summary oracles are available,\
      \ when rendering completes, then available subcomponents render and unavailable\
      \ ones remain in loading/hidden states without breaking layout."

  title: Show metric tiles for average class proficiency, average assessment score,
    and average student progress only when applicable in the selected scope.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-003
    title: "(FR-003, FR-004) \u2014 Given selected scope has no objectives or no assessments,\
      \ when summary renders, then corresponding tiles are hidden and remaining tiles\
      \ expand to fill available space."

  title: AI recommendation panel renders scoped recommendation content with thinking
    and beginning-course fallback states.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-004
    title: "(FR-005) \u2014 Given no meaningful activity exists yet, when summary\
      \ renders, then beginning-course recommendation message is shown instead of\
      \ fabricated recommendation."

  title: Recommendation regenerate action must be disabled while a regenerate request
    is in flight and re-enabled on completion/failure.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-005
    title: "(FR-006) \u2014 Given instructor clicks regenerate, when request is in\
      \ progress, then regenerate button is disabled and thinking state is visible\
      \ until response/error."

  title: Summary metrics and recommendation must update on global scope changes without
    full page reload.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-006
    title: "(FR-007) \u2014 Given instructor changes global scope, when scope update\
      \ completes, then all summary values and recommendation reflect new scope without\
      \ browser refresh."

  title: Recommendation feedback controls (thumbs up/down and regenerate trigger surface)
    are displayed and wired for downstream feedback handling contracts.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-007
    title: "(FR-008) \u2014 Given recommendation is displayed, when instructor interacts\
      \ with thumbs/re-generate controls, then events route through defined contracts\
      \ and UI state remains consistent."

  title: Tile projections and data shaping for metrics are implemented in non-UI modules,
    with UI components consuming projection output only.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-008
    title: "(FR-009) \u2014 Given code review and tests, when summary logic is inspected,\
      \ then data projection logic is isolated from UI rendering components."
