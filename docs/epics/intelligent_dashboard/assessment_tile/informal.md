## Ticket Description
User Story As an instructor, I want to view assessment completion, performance metrics, and answer distributions so that I can understand how students are performing and quickly dig into specific assessments when needed. Acceptance Criteria Positive Acceptance Criteria Assessments Tile Presence Given  an instructor is viewing the Learning Dashboard Then  an  Assessments  expandable card (dropdown tile) is displayed And  the tile description reads: “Track assessment completion and performance.” The Assessments tile displays assessments scoped to the currently selected global course content filter: Entire Course → all assessments in the course Unit / Module → only assessments within that container If there are  no scored pages  in a course Then  do not display this tile Assessment List (Collapsed State) The tile displays a list of assessments: Ordered by  due date  (most recent first) Labeled with relevant course context (e.g.,  Unit 2 · Module 1 ), when applicable Displays: Assessment title Available date Due date Expanded Assessment Details When  an instructor selects the expand/collapse caret for an assessment Then  the following details are displayed for that assessment: Completion Status Displays completion status as: “X of Y students completed” Completion is defined as  scored page completion , not attempt exhaustion Completion status includes a visual chip: Red  if fewer than 50% of students have completed Green  if 50% or more of students have completed Email Students Not Completed An  “Email students not completed”  button is displayed When  selected: An email modal opens The email is pre-addressed to students who have not completed the assessment Score Distribution Visualization Displays a score distribution chart for the assessment: X-axis:  score values Y-axis:  number of students Student counts are: Displayed  above each bar  (not only on hover) Rounded to two decimal places if necessary Score Metrics Displays the following score metrics: Minimum score Median score Mean score Maximum score Standard deviation Mean score follows existing assessment score color logic (consistent with the assessment scores gradebook): Displayed in  red  if below the defined threshold Displayed in  green  if above the threshold Review Questions A  “Review questions”  button is displayed When  selected: The instructor is navigated to the associated  scored page question view  for that assessment View Assessment Scores When  an instructor selects the  “View Assessment Scores”  button: Then  they are navigated to Overview > Assessment scores Negative Acceptance Criteria Given  an assessment has no student submissions Then  completion, score metrics, and distribution visualizations display an appropriate empty state Given  an assessment has no due date Then  ordering falls back to available date or default course order Given  the instructor rapidly expands and collapses multiple assessments Then  the UI remains stable and no expanded state conflicts occur Given  navigation to the scored page question view fails Then  an error message is displayed rather than leaving the instructor in an undefined state Design Notes Component    “Bad status” “Good status” Technical Notes Testing Notes

## Technical Guidance Notes (Darren Siegel Jira comments)
This is a feature, use slug assessment_tile Data from the grades oracle should come already aggregated and ready to display.  You may need to pair this with the content oracle or direct reads to SectionResourceDepot to get the assessment title.  But “available_at” an “due” and all the other aggregated stats will be in the oracle payload, with no need to project.
