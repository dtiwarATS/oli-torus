  title: Render Assessments tile for selected scope when at least one graded page
    exists.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-001
    title: "(FR-001, FR-002) \u2014 Given selected scope includes graded assessments,\
      \ when tile renders, then assessment rows appear using aggregated oracle payload\
      \ data."

  title: Pair aggregated assessment data with content titles from content oracle/depot
    metadata where needed for display labels.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-002
    title: "(FR-003) \u2014 Given assessment payload contains resource identifiers,\
      \ when tile renders, then human-readable assessment titles are shown from content\
      \ metadata mapping."

  title: Display per-assessment score statistics (min/median/mean/max/std dev) and
    completion counts per design.
  status: proposed

  - id: AC-003
    title: "(FR-004) \u2014 Given assessment aggregate stats are present, when tile\

  title: Display score-range distribution bins from oracle output without recomputation
    in UI layer.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-004
    title: "(FR-005) \u2014 Given score bin distributions are present, when tile renders,\
      \ then distribution visualization reflects oracle-provided bins without client-side\
      \ re-aggregation."

  title: Reflect selected global scope and update consistently when scope changes.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-005
    title: "(FR-006) \u2014 Given instructor changes global scope, when update completes,\
      \ then tile values reflect only new scope data."

  title: If no graded assessments exist in selected scope, tile shows conditional
    empty state or is omitted according to section-composition rules.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-006
    title: "(FR-007) \u2014 Given no graded assessments exist for selected scope,\
      \ when tile evaluates visibility, then configured empty/omitted state behavior\
      \ is applied consistently."

  title: Keep all projection/normalization logic in non-UI module; UI renders view
    models only.
  status: proposed
  acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-007
    title: "(FR-008) \u2014 Given code review and tests, when assessment tile logic\
      \ is inspected, then non-UI projection module boundaries are preserved."
